# Default-of-credit-card-clients-classification.
This is an academic machine learning project that consists of using multiple machine leaning models in order to classify the clients who will probably have a default of payement for the next month.

The data science methodology used in this project is the IBM CRISP-DM.

The machine learning models used in this project are:
  1- K-nearest neighbor classifiers
  2- Logestic regression
  3- Discriminant analysis
  4- Naive Bayes classifier
  5- Artificial neural networks
  6- Classification trees
With the use of ensemble learning techniques:
  1- RandomForset
  2- AdaBoost
  3- Gradient boost
  4- xgBoost

You can find comments in the notebook that explain every step and its results.
